feat(validation): centralize payment rate validation across store and form

Consolidate scattered validation logic into a single source of truth to improve
maintainability and data integrity.

WHY:
- Previously, rate validation existed only in the form layer (Zod schema) and
  localStorage loading, leaving the store vulnerable to invalid state
- Invalid rates (negative, NaN, out-of-range) could be set directly via store
  mutation methods without validation, creating data integrity issues
- Hardcoded validation constants (25-200) were repeated in multiple places,
  making future constraint changes tedious and error-prone
- No feedback mechanism to callers when invalid rates were rejected

WHAT:
- Export RATE_VALIDATION constants and isValidRate() function from ratesUtils.ts
  as the single source of truth for rate constraints
- Update store setter methods (setWeekdayRate, setWeekendRate) to return boolean:
  - Returns false if rate fails validation (prevents mutation)
  - Returns true if rate passes validation (updates state and persists)
  - Logs console warning when rates are rejected for developer feedback
- Update form validation schema to import and use RATE_VALIDATION constants
  instead of hardcoded values
- Add comprehensive test coverage (28 new tests) for validation edge cases:
  - Boundary conditions (min=25, max=200)
  - Invalid types (NaN, negative, out-of-range)
  - localStorage persistence (valid rates only)
  - Return value contract (boolean success/failure)

RESULT:
- Store now validates all setter calls—invalid rates cannot be persisted
- Single point of maintenance for validation rules (RATE_VALIDATION)
- Form and store validation always stay in sync
- Improved developer experience with explicit success/failure feedback
- 418 tests passing, 100% type-safe
